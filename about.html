          <p>
            Hello, my name is Summer Burbo (connect with me on LinkedIn
            <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/sburbo">here</a>!) Recently, I
            signed up for a three-month intensive front-end development course.
            I am learning to design and code websites while employed in an
            apprentice program. The company mentoring me with real-world
            experience is Above Promotions.
          </p>

          <ol>
            There are three reasons why I want to become a front-end web
            developer:
            <li>
              I enjoy solving problems. Front-end developers are equally
              creative and analytical. It’s about design and making things more
              functional for users. One day I would like to design for an
              organization like The Walt Disney Company.
            </li>
            <li>
              I want a successful career. Front-end developers are in high
              demand and have lots of job security. I want to be able to make
              innovative, user intuitive websites. Participating in this course
              is helping me toward that goal.
            </li>
            <li>
              I like helping people. Front-end development is very
              collaborative. You work with lots of people to bring a vision to
              life. One of my favorite websites is Tumblr. I’m inspired when I
              think about how many people contribute to that website and also
              use it. I want to be of service and see my work in action.
            </li>
          </ol>

          <ul>
            During my front-end development program, I am learning:
            <li>
              Web design principles, including how to design user interfaces,
              accessibility features, UX functions, and mobile-optimized
              websites;
            </li>
            <li>HTML, CSS, and Javascript;</li>
            <li>
              Responsive web development, including how to code using the
              Bootstrap framework;
            </li>
            <li>Prototyping tools, including Figma;</li>
            <li>Development tools like Github and the Command Line;</li>
            <li>WordPress website design;</li>
            <li>Web application development;</li>
            <li>…and much more.</li>
          </ul>
