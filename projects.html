              Web developers typically redesign websites rather than creating
              them from scratch. In this project, I overhauled a pizza
              restaurant’s site, enhancing functionality and design. I created a
              mock-up for a pizza ordering app and worked on basic HTML and CSS
              for additional features, with more to come.

              During my front-end development program, I created projects for a
              fictional travel company, “Florida Wishes”. This included project
              briefs, user personas, brand boards, mockups, and responsive
              websites, showcasing incremental skills and progress. Each element
              contributed to a comprehensive skill-building experience.

              Throughout my front-end development program, I engaged in various
              one-off projects to enhance my skills. Notable projects include a
              customized Figma prototype featuring my pets and a wireframe of
              OMSOM's landing page, which helped me learn wireframing
              techniques. Both can be viewed on the respective links.
